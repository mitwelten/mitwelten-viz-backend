# UI/UX from Mitwelten Dashboard

## General
Here you can find everything about the design-concept of this bachelor project.

## UI Sketches
Sketches are used to show and record the most important core functions. These also serve to create an overview of what the web application is about. The sketches were drawn with the Ipad and pen. You can find the sketches [here](https://github.com/mitwelten/mitwelten-hs20-imvs02/tree/43-UX/UI-Prototype/ui%26ux/sketches).

## Low-Fidelity Prototype
A low-fidelity prototype is a prototype in which the focus is on user guidance and functionality largely detached from the design. The appearance of the application is neglected in this prototype.
This prototype can be clicked to convey a feeling of how the application can be operated. For this we decided to use the graphics tool Balsamiq. You can see the different screens that we have created [here](https://github.com/mitwelten/mitwelten-hs20-imvs02/tree/43-UX/UI-Prototype/ui%26ux/lofi)

## High Fidelity Prototype
High-fidelity prototypes are highly functional and interactive. They are very close to the final product because most of the required design assets and components are developed and integrated. High-fidelity was an important step for us to identify workflow issues. It also helped us with the implementation since they are very tightly linked. Since this is again a prototype we were able to test the application through usability testing before implementation and get valuable feedback.

We used the Figma graphics tool for the high-fidelity prototypes. With this link [here](https://www.figma.com/file/tJcQzTwvNpI44aG5Ng96Kr/IP6?node-id=160%3A3) you can get to the platform of the prototype. There you will find the different flows and screens of the web application as it should finally look like when implemented.

Furthermore you can start the prototype with this link [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/tJcQzTwvNpI44aG5Ng96Kr/IP6?node-id=638%3A955&scaling=scale-down&page-id=627%3A350&starting-point-node-id=627%3A351&show-proto-sidebar=1) and click around how the webapplication can be operated at the end of the implementation.

In the folder [hifi](https://github.com/mitwelten/mitwelten-hs20-imvs02/tree/43-UX/UI-Prototype/ui%26ux/hifi) you will find a file called HiFi-Prototype.fig.
This file contains all the versions that have been made including the current version. This Figma file can be imported from the Figma website or locally if you have downloaded Figma on your desktop.
